# SAP IoT Edge Samples

# DEPRECATED: SAMPLES MOVED TO [SAP IoT Samples](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-iot-samples/tree/main/iot-edge-samples)

This folder contains all the [SAP IoT](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_IoT) Edge Samples for the Containerized Edge Services


## Scenario Overview

| Scenario      | Overview      | Link          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Proxy Application Extension Service | This sample implements a Proxy application designed to operate with the SAP Edge Gateway Service REST. The application ingests user defined payloads measurement packets and forward it to the SAP Edge Gateway Service in the correct format. The application could also ingests binary file and forward it to the SAP IoT. | [proxy-app](https://github.com/SAP-samples/iot-edge-samples/tree/main/IoT_Edge/customservice)  |
| DFT Algorithm as Extension Service | Simple implementation of Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm as Extension Service. | [dft](https://github.com/SAP-samples/iot-edge-samples/tree/main/IoT_Edge/dft)  |
| Edge Gateway Service Reference Application | This sample is a custom extension service for testing the SAP Edge Gateway Service behavior. | [edge-gateway-app](https://github.com/SAP-samples/iot-edge-samples/tree/main/IoT_Edge/edge-gateway-service-ref-app)  |
| Persistence Service Reference Application | This sample is a custom extension service that demonstrates the creation of a custom schema from Persistence Service. The reference app also allows for sending measure data to Edge Gateway Service using a built-in oData API, as well as viewing measure data from Persistence Service. | [persistence-app](https://github.com/SAP-samples/iot-edge-samples/tree/main/IoT_Edge/persistence-service-ref-app)  |
| Node Red IoT Add-on | Low code programming [Node Red](https://nodered.org/) dashboard and pre-configured flows capabilities to integrate SAP Edge Gateway Service, SAP Persistence Service, SAP Extension Services, including data consumption pipeline interfaces. | [node-red-addon](https://github.com/SAP-samples/iot-edge-samples/tree/main/IoT_Edge/node-red-iot-addon)  |

## How to obtain support

These samples are provided "as-is" basis with detailed documentation on how to use them.
